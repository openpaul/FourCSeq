Description: FourCSeq is an R package dedicated to the analysis of
    (multiplexed) 4C sequencing data. The package provides a
    pipeline to detect specific interactions between DNA elements
    and identify differential interactions between conditions. The
    statistical analysis in R starts with individual bam files for
    each sample as inputs. To obtain these files, the package
    contains a python script (extdata/python/demultiplex.py) to
    demultiplex libraries and trim off primer sequences. With a
    standard alignment software the required bam files can be then
    be generated.
